ANS 1)
Statement
It is used to execute normal SQL queries.
It usually used when SQL query is needed to be executed only one time.
Parameters cannot be passed to SQL query using this interface.
It is mainly used for DDL statements like CREATE,ALTER,DROP etc.
Its performace is comparably low .
Example :
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement( );

PreparedStatement
It is used to execute parameterized SQL queries.
It usually used when SQL query is needed to be executed multiple times.
Parameters can be passed to SQL query using this interface.
It is used for any kind of SQL query.
Its performance is better than Statement.
Example :
String abc = "Update Employees SET age = ? WHERE id = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(abc);

CallableStatement
It is used to call the stored procedures.
It usually used when stored procedures are to be executed.
Three parameters can be passed to SQL query using this interface they are: IN,OUT,INOUT.
It is used to execute stored procedures and functions.
Its performance is better than Statement,PreparedStatement.
Example :
String abc = "{call procedurename (?, ?)}";
CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall (abc);


ANS 2)
Need of connection object :
Connection object is used represents a connection with a database
It creates the Statement, PreparedStatement and CallableStatement objects for executing the SQL statements.
It is needed to Commit or roll back a jdbc transaction.
with connection object we can gathers information about the database or data source by the use of DatabaseMetaData.
It is needed to close the data source.Connection.isClosed() method is used to close all the connection.

ANS 3)
    UPDATE emp set salary=salary+((5*salary)/100) where salary >0;

ANS 4)
A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements that are stored together in a database.
Based on the statements in the procedure and the parameters passed it can be used to perform one or multiple DML operations on the database.
stored procedures can be invoked using triggers, other procedures or applications. 
it can be used to pass the same statements multiple times which increases reusability.
There are 3 different types of parameters that can be passesd to stored procedures : 
1) IN: 
This is the Default Parameter for the procedure. It receives the values from calling program.
2) OUT: 
This parameter sends the values to the calling program.
2) IN OUT: 
This parameter is used to performs both the IN and OUT operations.

Example:
CREATE PROCEDURE AverageMarks(OUT average INT)
BEGIN
SELECT AVG(marks) INTO avrg FROM profile;
END

we call a stored procedure in java using CallableStatement
Example:
CallableStatement stmt=con.prepareCall("{call avgmarks(?}");

ANS 5)
The benefits of using a trigger are :

Allows us to reuse the queries.
It Helps to detect errors on the database level.
It helps in maintaining the integrity constraints in the database tables.
It Helps to automate the data alterations.It useful for the purpose of auditing of the changes made in the table
It improve performance in client/server environment.
It helps in keeping the SQL codes short and simple.
Provides a method to check the data integrity of the database.



ANS 6)
The difference between Join & Union are : 	 
JOIN:
Join are used when we want to fetch data from multiple table based on some similar data.
There are four major types of the JOIN clause- the LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, and INNER JOIN.
It combines data into new columns.
Number of columns selected from each table may not be same.
Result set can have different types of data types
It may not return distinct columns.
It doesn't remove duplicate data.

Example:
SELECT abc
FROM TableA
INNER JOIN
TableB 



UNION:
It can be used to combine the result set of two different SELECT statement.
There are two major types of the UNION clause- the UNION and the UNION ALL.
It combines data into new rows.
Number of columns selected from each table should be same.
Data type should be same as the  result set of each select statement
It removes duplicate rows between the various select statements.
It returns distinct rows.

Example:
SELECT abc
FROM tableA
UNION
SELECT abc
FROM tableB



ANS 7)
DDL :
It stands for Data Definition Language.
DDL consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema.
It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database.
DDL is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data.
DDL has no further classification.

List of DDL commands: 
CREATE: This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers).
DROP: This command is used to delete objects from the database.
ALTER: This is used to alter the structure of the database.
COMMENT: This is used to add comments to the data dictionary.
RENAME: This is used to rename an object existing in the database.
EXAMPLE->Create database java2023;


DML :
It stands for Data Manipulation Language.
The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML.
It is the component of the SQL statement that controls access to data and to the database.
DML is further classified into procedural DML and non-procedural DML.

List of DML commands: 
INSERT : It is used to insert data into a table.
UPDATE: It is used to update existing data within a table.
DELETE : It is used to delete records from a database table.
LOCK: Table control concurrency.
EXAMPLE->
UPDATE students    
SET FirstName = 'abc', LastName= 'def' 
WHERE StudID = 3;


DQL :
It stands for Data Query Language.
DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects.
The purpose of the DQL Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it
it is a component of SQL statement that allows getting data from the database and imposing order upon it.

List of DQL: 
SELECT: It is used to retrieve data from the database.
EXAMPLE->
SELECT FirstName  
FROM Student  
WHERE RollNo > 15; 


ANS 8)
Basic steps for JDBC:
1. Fetch Driver
2. Create Connection
3. Create SQL Statement
4. Execute SQL Queries
5. Close the Connection


1. Fetch Driver
The Class.forName() method is used to register the driver class dynamically.

For example:
Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");

2. Create Connection
The DriverManager class provides the getConnection() method to establish connection object.
It requires to pass a database url, username and password.
For example:
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection ("jdbc:mysql://localhost/abc,"root","");

3. Create SQL Statement
The Connection interface provides the createStatement() method to create SQL statement.
Example:
Statement stmt = con.createStatement();

4. Execute SQL Queries
The Statement interface provides the executeQuery( ) method to execute SQL statements.
Example
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("insert into employee(id,marks)values(1,70));

5. Close the Connection
The Connection interface provides close( ) method, used to close the connection. 
It is invoked to release the session after execution of SQL statement.
Example:
con.close( );
